Project Submission Deadline: Sunday 9am
Event kickoff Friday 7:30pm

Submission Requirements：https://ethglobal.com/events/ethsanfrancisco2022/project

Code of conduct
We do not allow participants to submit pre-existing projects - you may start working on your project once hacking officially begins at event kick-off.
You should not be working on you project before the event officially begins. This includes coding, designing assets, etc. Each hack submission will be judged solely on the quality of the work completed during the duration of the hackathon. We require everyone starts building from scratch - if there is a situation where a project/team are porting or continuing existing projects, you may continue to participate but you will not be eligible for being a finalist.
You may use any pre-existing code in your project only after you have notified the ETHGlobal team in writing about the nature of previously done work and have gotten approval. Further, you need to disclose all relevant information in your submission video, project description, and during judging clarifying what specifically was done before the hackathon. If, upon inspection, you present work that appears to have been completed before the hackathon began that was not disclosed, you will need to explicitly point out how your new work differs from old work.
By using any pre-existing work (even after written approval), you forfeit the right to be considered as a finalist for the hackathon.
In order to ensure that no pre-existing work makes its way into the submission, you must also use version control for your code throughout the course of the event. Any repositories with single commits of large files without proper history will be default assumed to be unqualified unless proven otherwise.
Historically, projects that use a majority of pre-existing work do not score as high in the judging as projects which present wholly new and novel approaches - the goal of our hackathons is to create interesting experiments.
